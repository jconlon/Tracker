h1. TruTest Proxy Feature

The TruTest feature is an iRouter feature containing a proxy component factory and TruTest specific business logic component Factories that creates user configurable services instances[14] for interfacing with TruTest animal scale-heads[15]. 


h2. Proxy Component Factory

The TruTest Proxy Component Factory creates services for:
* Synchronizing Animal Life Data on startup
** Exporting of animal life data to a file in a specified directory on the filesystem
** Importing of animal life data
*** Received as a list of records sent from an active iRouter data synchronization producer service
*** From a specified directory on the file system
* Producing weight and key state information
* Consuming raw TruTest protocol commands

h3. Consumer Scopes

TruTest Service Instances consume TruTest protocol commands that are produced by other TruTest and iRouter service instances. 

h3. Producer Scopes

TruTest Service Instances produce wireAdmin products that are consumed by business logic and logging components. TruTest Service Instances produce weight measurements, animal tag numbers, and transaction state.

h2. Business Logic Component Factories

h3. Measurement Adapter

Measurement Adapter is a Measurement Consumer and a TruTest Command producer. It consumes Measurements and converts them into TruTest commands for displaying the Measurement values in fields on a TruTest Indicator.  

h3. EID Adapter

EID Adapter is a Animal ID(Identification) number Consumer and a TruTest Command producer. It consumes Animal IDs and converts them into TruTest commands for inputing EID(Electronic animal IDentification) values to a TruTest Indicator.  

h3. Alarm Adapter

Alarm Adapter is a State Consumer and a TruTest Command producer. It consumes States and converts them into TruTest commands to turn on and off the alarm in a TruTest Indicator.  

Reception of a distinct state sends commands to the TruTest Proxy service instances to turn on the alarm, while reception of any other state sends commands to the TruTest Proxy service instance to turn the alarm off.

h2. Notes

fn14. TruTest service instances are implemented as WireAdmin Producer and Consumer services.

fn15. The Tracker Device Simulator product has implemented a simulator of the TruTest scale head. This simulator can be used for testing and validating iRouter configurations utilizing TruTest Service Instances.
