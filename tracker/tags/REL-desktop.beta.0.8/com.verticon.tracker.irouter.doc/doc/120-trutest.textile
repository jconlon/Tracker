h1. TruTest Proxy Feature

The TruTest Proxy feature is an iRouter _Proxy Component Factory_ and a _Business Logic Component Factory_ for creating 
services[14] for interfacing with "TruTest":http://www.tru-test.com animal scale-heads. 


h2. Proxy Component Factory

The TruTest[15] Proxy Component Factory creates service instances that:
* Synchronize TruTest scalehead animal life data;
** Animal life data from the TruTest scalehead is sent to a file in a specified user directory 
** Animal life data from the computer is sent to TruTest scalehead as a list of records either from:
*** An iRouter Animal Life Data Component service (For details see the Premises Gateway Feature documentation)
*** A file named animalLifeDataUpLoad.txt in a specified directory on the system file system
* Detect and send animal weights and _Enter_ key  states
** TruTest Proxy instances will detect scalehead animal weights and operator keypress information producing:
**_Measurement_ products that contain the weights read by the scalehead 
** _State_ information indicating that an operator pressed the _Enter_ key  
* Provide a modular and simple framework for custom TruTest scalehead integration 
** TruTest Proxy instances consume raw TruTest protocol commands produced by other iRouter components for:
*** custom control of the scalehead 
*** display of values on the scalehead fields 

h3. Consumer Scopes

TruTest Proxy Service Instances consume @wireAdmin@ products containing TruTest protocol commands which are produced by TruTest Business Logic instances. __See below.__

h3. Producer Scopes

TruTest Service Instances produce @wireAdmin@ products that are consumed by iRouter business logic and logging components. TruTest Service Instances produce weight _Measurement_ products, animal tag _Numbers_, and key press _State_ products.

h2. Business Logic Component Factories

h3. Measurement Adapter

Measurement Adapter is a _Measurement_ Consumer and a TruTest Command producer. It consumes _Measurement_ products from generic iRouter component instances and converts these to produce TruTest command products that can be sent to a TruTest Proxy instance for displaying Measurement values in fields on a TruTest Indicator.  

h3. EID Adapter

EID Adapter is a Animal ID(Identification) number Consumer and a TruTest Command producer. It consumes generic Animal IDs and converts them into TruTest commands for inputing EID(Electronic animal IDentification) values to a TruTest Indicator.  

h3. Alarm Adapter

Alarm Adapter consumes _State_ products and produces TruTest Command products. It consumes States and converts them into TruTest commands in order to turn on and off the alarm in a TruTest Indicator.  

Reception of a distinct _State_ sends command products to the TruTest Proxy service instances to turn on the alarm, while reception of any other _State_ sends command products to the TruTest Proxy service instance to turn the alarm off.

h2. Notes

fn14. TruTest service instances are implemented as WireAdmin Producer and Consumer services.

fn15. The Tracker Device Simulator product has implemented a simulator of the TruTest scale head. This simulator can be used for testing and validating iRouter configurations utilizing TruTest Service Instances.
