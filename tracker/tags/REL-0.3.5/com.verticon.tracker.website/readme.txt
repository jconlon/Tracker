This project is a builder for the com.verticon.tracker website.

=======================================
Notes

The docBook external resources reside in /opt/Docbook/Silkpage and are referenced
by the build.

build.properties specify build PROPERTIES (duh)

cfg/catalog.xml specify critical xml resources.  (Don't forget next time!)

?Does the website.database.xml need to be in the repo?
