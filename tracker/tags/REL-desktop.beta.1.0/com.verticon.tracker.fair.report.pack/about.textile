{toc:style=disc|minLevel=2|maxLevel=3}

h2(. Introduction

The Tracker Fair Report Pack is a suite of BIRT Reports and Resources that reference fair documents and premises documents as data sources. Tracker Fair Report Pack reports do not contain hard coded paths to premises and fair documents, so they need no modification to target different premises and fair documents. 

On installation, Tracker Report Packs will be detected and its reports and resources will deployed to the workspaces ReportViewer Servlet Working Path folder (specified by the @birt.viewer.root.path@ system property), Reports can then be called via a Browswer with URL parameters using relative non-system specific paths.


h2(. Datasources

Tracker Fair Report Pack reports utilize property files or hidden report parameters to set up the datasource documents.  If the report is run with the Report Parameters embedded in the url 
@&rp_premises_doc=platform%3A%2Fresource%2Fcom.verticon.tracker.fair.example%2Fexample.premises&rp_fair_doc=platform%3A%2Fresource%2Fcom.verticon.tracker.fair.example%2Fexample.fair@ then the report will use the @example.premises@ and the @example.fair@ documents from the @com.verticon.tracker.fair.example@ project as the datasources.  If the report parameters are not passed during launch then the report will load the local @report.properties@ file and the value of the @rp_premises_doc@ and @rp_fair_doc@ parameters.
