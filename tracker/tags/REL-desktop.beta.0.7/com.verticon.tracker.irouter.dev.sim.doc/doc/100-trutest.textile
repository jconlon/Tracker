h3. Display and Controls

Connection state from the iRouter client components to the Server is shown as a display with a Y/N value. 

On connection the iRouter components will download current Indicator records, and upload new indicator records. The number of records up/downloaded are shown on the simulator as Download and Upload fields.

Two Display fields simulate the two TruTest custom File Data Fields.[6]

An EID selector presents a drop down list of EID values created from the list of EID numbers uploaded to the server.[7]

The last controls simulate the weighing of animals. These can be incremented by manual button press for each increment or weights can be automatically incremented by a single button press.
 
Lastly a record control is used to record the transaction.
