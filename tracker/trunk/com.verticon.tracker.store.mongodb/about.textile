h1=. Tracker Mongo Store

com.verticon.tracker.store.mongo Version 2.0.1

{toc:style=disc|minLevel=2|maxLevel=3}


h2. Introduction

Tracker Mongo Store is a multi-user enterprise class solution for storage and retrieval of Livestock Business Intelligence documents. 



h2. Users of Tracker Desktop

Authorized users of the Tracker Desktop can archive Premises animal life data and event histories to a MongoDB data store. Authorized users can also retrieve information about  
* a single animal and its
** event history 
** route between premises locations
* all the animals in a premises within a specified time frame
** event histories of all animals

h3. Desktop Support Requirements

# Administration 
## User designated as an Administrator
## Manages access rules for all other users
### Access rules are document based and are loaded by the administrator into MongoDB
### Users are identified by the user name and the machine name they are logged into
### Users are authorized to publish animal event histories from one or more premises
### Users must be authorized by the administrator to read animal event histories from other premises than their own
# Tracker Desktop archival of Agriculture GeoLocations, Premises and Animals
## Archival support for one or multiple Premises
# Tracker Desktop retrieval 
## All animals in a Premises
### Given a date range and premises uri a retrieval request will generate Tracker premises documents containing animals that were resident during the given date range
## Single animal
### Given an animal id, creates KML documents for individual animals showing Geo location routing between Premises locations
# Eclipse BIRT will support the reporting of geo locations, animal histories and movements 

h2. iRouter Support

iRouter sensor and actuator networks can now use MongoDB for real time transaction recording of any Tracker Premises events.

h3. iRouter Component Requirements

# Animal Tag recording to MongoDB
## Tags can contain one or more events
## Runs in iRouter appliances for headless applications for automatic recording of tag events from one or more fixed sensors
## Runs in Tracker Desktop BI Toolkit for hands free saving of animals, tags and events originating in iRouter sensor networks
## Multiple components instances can be configured to connect to one or more MongoDB stores
## Supports event updates to existing animals and the runtime creation of new animals
## iRouter Consumer component that leverages the power of the iRouter infrastructure for creating complex sensor and actuator based solutions.
## Configurable instances can support one or more tag readers or virtual tag producers

h2. Implementation
 
An OSGi Declarative Services Factory component which implements an iRouter (Tag) Consumer and a com.verticon.tracker.store.ITrackerStore.
 
 
h2. iRouter Example

Goal: Demonstrate an iRouter component configuration that highlights the functionality of the Tracker Mongo Store
# Components used
## TruTest Proxy 
*** This will serve at the top of the event production chain to produce events associated with a TruTest scale head indicator
**** The scale will produce events as the weights of the animals are changed, these weight measurements will be sent in the _raw.animal.weight_ scope
**** When an animal EID is detected on the scale head that eid will be produced in the _animal.eid_ scope
**** When the operator presses the Enter Button that event will be produced in the _transaction.state_ scope  
## Premises Event Producer
*** This component will consume all products sent by the TruTest Proxy and on the detection of a _transaction.state_ indicating that the operator pressed the Enter Button, this component will produce the last measurement received and identify it with the animal eid.
## Premises Animal Producer
*** This component also sits towards the top of the event production chain, but consumes Animal EIDs on the _animal.eid_ scope and Enter Button presses on the _transaction.state_ scope that have originated on the TruTest Proxy.  Associated with this component is a _URI_ referencing an Tracker Premises Animal template in an external document. Production cycle of this component starts when a Enter Button press is detected. Then the Animal Template is copied, given the EID from the TruTest, and sent to consumers.
## Tracker Mongo Store consumes products from the Premises Event Producer and the Premises Animal Producer and creates these on the MongoDB. 
# Startup and Configuration
## MongoDB must be installed and running on the local host
## Startup Tracker
## From the _Configuration_ menu, invoke _Import iRouter Configuration_
## Import that configuration _autotype.metatype_ document in this project
# TruTest simulator
## Download and install the Tracker simulator product 
## In the installation directory run the simulator executable
## In a web browser go to "Simulated Devices":http://localhost:8081/client/devices and start the TruTest simulator
## Select a TruTest simulator 
## When the TruTest simulator comes up the _Connection_ should be Y
## Change the EID, the weight and press the record button to simulate a transaction

In the iRouter Monitor View you should see the components displayed something like:
