h1=. BIRT Report Loader UI

com.verticon.birt.report.loader.ui Version 0.1.0

{toc:style=disc|minLevel=2|maxLevel=3}

h2(. Introduction

When BIRT Designer is installed in Eclipse or an RCP, the ReportViewer runs as a Servlet. Reports can be run, from popup menus in the Navigator View or Web Browsers can launch reports by opening an URL with the proper parameters set to the ReportViewer Servlet.  When viewing reports with a Web Browser URL parameters are used to identify file system paths to report design documents and shared resource folders.  

If Reports and Resources are loaded to the ReportViewer Servlet Working Path folder (specified by the @birt.viewer.working.path@ system property), Reports can be called via a Browswer with URL parameters using relative non-system specific paths.


h2(. Requirements

Give report designers a simple action to load reports to the @report@ subdirectory of the @birt.viewer.working.path@ folder.

h2(. Implementation
 
Create a popup action on all @*.rptdesign@ files to copy reports to the @report@ subdirectory of the @birt.viewer.working.path@ folder.
