h2(. Introduction

Tracker Fair Reports utilize fair documents and premises documents as data sources. While BIRT Fair based reports can contain hard coded paths to premises and fair documents, Tracker Fair reports need no modification to target different premises and fair documents. 

Tracker Reports utilize property files or hidden report parameters to set up the datasource documents.  If the report is run with the Report Parameters embedded in the url 
@&rp_premises_doc=platform%3A%2Fresource%2FExample_Fair%2Fexample.premises&rp_fair_doc=platform%3A%2Fresource%2FExample_Fair%2Fexample.fair@ then the report will use the @example.premises@ and the @example.fair@ documents from the @Example_Fair@ project as the datasources.  If the report parameters are not passed during launch then the report will load the local @report.properties@ file and the value of the @rp_premises_doc@ and @rp_fair_doc@ parameters.
