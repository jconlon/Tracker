h2(. Introduction

Tracker Premises Reports utilize premises documents as data sources. While BIRT Premises based reports can contain hard coded paths to premises documents, Tracker Premises reports need no modification to target different premises documents. 

Tracker Reports utilize property files or hidden report parameters to set up the datasource documents.  If the report is run with the Report Parameter embedded in the url @&rp_premises_doc=platform%3A%2Fresource%2FExample_Farm%2Fexample.premises@ then the report will use the @example.premises@ document from the @Example_Farm@ project as the datasource.  If the report parameter is not passed during launch then the report will load the local @report.properties@ file and the value of the @rp_premises_doc@ parameter.

h2(. Shared Resources

To minimize duplication the Tracker Reports infrastructure utilize a shared BIRT resource library.

h3(. Installation

# Create a shared resource directory on your machine
# Add the libraries in the @Library@ directory to the resource directory
# Add any files in the @Styles@ directory to the resource directory
# Copy report(s) to target project
# Copy the @report.properties@ file to the target project in the same directory as the copied reports
# Edit the @report.properties@ to reference the target premises document.
