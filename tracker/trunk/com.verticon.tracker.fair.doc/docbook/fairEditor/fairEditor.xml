      <title>What is the Fair Editor?</title>
      <para>The Fair Editor is a comprehensive open desktop solution for documenting, managing, reporting and
      exchanging information associated with livestock animal fairs and expositions.  The Fair Editor is used for
      creating and editing documents that conform to the Fair information (data) model. Fair documents extend
      and compliment livestock animal history information held in Premises documents with 
      fair exhibits, exhibitors, youth clubs, awards, and exhibitor parents information.</para>

      <title>Project Goals</title>
      <para>Livestock fairs and animal expositions are special kinds of livestock premises where the 
      information associated with people, clubs, animals, exhibits, contest activities, and awards are recorded and 
      managed.  The goal of the Tracker Fair Editor is to create a comprehensive desktop based software application 
      for Livestock fairs and expositions. An application that:
