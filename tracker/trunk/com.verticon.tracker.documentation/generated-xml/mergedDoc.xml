		<title>The Good Shepherd</title>
		<para>
			The tracking and shepherding of animals are fundamental
			activities of all modern and prehistoric human
			civilizations. Either for hunting or husbandry human beings
			have always observed and remembered animal movements. Today
			with larger herds and more movements computer based tools to
			track animal movements can ease the burden and reduce the
			cost for farm animal producers and livestock infrastructure
			providers.

		<title>OCL Introduction</title>
		<para>
			The Object Constraint Language,
			<acronym>OCL</acronym>
			is a simple declarative language for specifying rules that
			apply to document models. Within Tracker, documents model an
			Agricultural Premises that contain Animals and an
			EventHistory of significant Events that happen to these
			Animals.
		</para>
		<para>
			Within Tracker Editors
			<acronym>OCL</acronym>
			rules can be used to both query and select specific
			information about the Animals and the Events that have taken
			place on the Premises.
		</para>

		<title>OCL Interpreter Examples</title>

			The following are example
			<acronym>OCL</acronym>
			Interpreter rules that can be used for the querying Tracker
			documents. All examples use the Context Premises.
