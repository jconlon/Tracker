		<title>Bulk Loading Events and Animals to Documents</title>
		<para>
			Although Tracker Editors make it easy to add individual
			animals and events to Premises Documents, individually
			adding dozens of animals, or hundreds of events to a
			Premises is not practical. For bulk loading of animals and
			events Tracker uses Animal Document Templates, Tag IdNumber
			files and event manipulation features to simplify the
			process.
		</para>
		<para>
			Like Tracker Premises Documents, Animal Document Templates
			are document files created by Tracker Wizards. Think of
			Animal Documents as containing some but not all the
			information that is in a Premises Document. Specifically a
			Animal Document is a Premises Document that only contains a
			single animal. Like an animal in the Premises Document, an
			Animal Document Template can contain a tag with an
			associated set of events. Animal Document Templates serve as
			a way to represent an event or a set of events that can then
			be applied to one or more specified animals in a Premises
			Document.
		</para>
		<para>
			Within a Premises Document you can specify which animals to
			apply the events contained in the Animal Document Template
			to, by:
			<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Directly selecting the animal or a set of
						animals in the Premises Document with mouse
						selections.
						<tip>
							<para>
								One or more animals in the Premises
								Document can also be selected with
								<acronym>OCL</acronym>
								Query operations. See
								<xref linkend="ch03" />
							</para>
						</tip>
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Indirectly selecting an animal or set of animals
						in the Premises Document from lists of
						Tag/@idNumbers contained in Tag IdNumber files.

		<title>Animal Document Templates</title>
		<para>
			Animal Document Templates are similar to Premises documents
			accept they use the *.animal extension, contain a default
			animal, an attached tag, and a set of representative events.
			Tracker Event manipulation utilities accessible through
			popup menus allow Animal Document Templates to be used to
			add various combinations of animals and/or events to
			specified sets of animals in the Premises Document.
		</para>
		<para>
			Animal Document Templates have the following
			characteristics:
			<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Contain a default Animal, a Tag and a set of
						representative events.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						If a Tag is included the Tag/@idNumber is not
						considered significant and is ignored.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Are persisted in files with a *.animal
						extension.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						All events are significant and will be copied to
						the specified Animal or set Animals in the
						Premises Document.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Timestamps of the events are considered
						significant and are copied to the events added
						to specified Animal or set of Animal in the
						Premises Document. The following are special
						exceptions:
						<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
							<listitem>
								<para>
									When a tags file name uses the
									format yyMMddHHmmss.tags. The dates
									of all events copied to the Premises
									Document will be assume the time
									stamp of
									<emphasis>yyMMddHHss</emphasis>
									. For example the tags file
									060409131111.Tags will set the date
									of all events to 04/09/06 13:11:11
								</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									When the date of an event in an Animal Document
									Template is set to a year 
									earlier than 1000 AD, then the
									date of the event copied to the Premises Document
									is set to the current time.
								</para>
							</listitem>

						</orderedlist>
						<note>
							<para>
								When Loading Events and Animals to Premises Documents
								using the Tracker Transaction

		<title>Tag IdNumber Files</title>
		<para>
			Most tag readers will transmit the numbers  
			representing the animal id as an
			<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
			encoded string (For more information on ASCII, see the
			Wikipedia entry for
			<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">
				<citetitle>ASCII</citetitle>
			</ulink>
			).
			<note>
				<para>
					In the Tracker Premises Model the id Number of the tags 
					are modeled as the Tag Element's idNumber attribute
					<code>Tag/@idNumber</code>.
				</para>
			</note>
			Memory based Tag Readers typically output multiple tag reads
			as lists of
			<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
			<code>Tag/@idNumber</code>
			strings in text files. Tracker calls
			<code>Tag/@idNumber</code>
			text files that have been saved with the *.tags extension a
			<emphasis>Tag IdNumber File</emphasis>
			.
		</para>
		<para>
			To indicate to Tracker that the read time of the tags in a
			Tag IdNumber file is significant, the name of the tag file
			may be formated to reflect that time. To timestamp a Tag
			IdNumber file use the formating of
			<code>yyMMddHHmmss</code>
			, where
			<simplelist type='horiz' columns='1'>
				<member>yy is the last two digits of the year,</member>
				<member>MM is the month,</member>
				<member>dd is the day of the month,</member>
				<member>
					HH is the hour of the day in 24 hour clock,
				</member>
				<member>mm is the minute of the hour,</member>
				<member>ss is the second</member>
			</simplelist>
			<example>
				<title>A Timestamped Tag IdNumber File Name</title>
				<formalpara>
					<title>060409131111.tags</title>
					<para>
						Specifies the date of all
						<code>Tag/@idNumber</code>
						reads to have occurred at 04/09/06 at 13:11:11.
