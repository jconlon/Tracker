		<title>Bulk Loading Events and Animals to Documents</title>
		<para>Although Tracker Editors make it easy to add individual animals and events to Premises Documents, individually adding dozens of animals, or hundreds of events to a Premises is not practical. For bulk loading of animals and events Tracker uses Animal Document Templates, Tag IdNumber files and event manipulation features to simplify the process.</para>
		<para>Like Tracker Premises Documents, Animal Document Templates are document files created by Tracker Wizards. Think of Animal Documents as containing some but not all the information that is in a Premises Document. Specifically a Animal Document is a Premises Document that only contains a single animal. Like an animal in the Premises Document, an Animal Document Template can contain a tag with an associated set of events. Animal Document Templates serve as a way to represent an event or a set of events that can then be applied to one or more specified animals in a Premises Document.</para>
		<para>Within a Premises Document you can specify which animals to apply the events contained in the Animal Document Template to, by:<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
				<listitem>
					<para>Directly selecting the animal or a set of animals in the Premises Document with mouse	selections.<tip>

		<title>Animal Document Templates</title>
		<para>
			Animal Document Templates are similar to Premises documents accept they use the *.animal extension, contain a default animal, an attached tag, and a set of representative events.  Tracker Event manipulation utilities accessible through popup menus allow Animal Document Templates to be used to add various combinations of animals and/or events to specified sets of animals in the Premises Document.
		</para>
		<para>
			Animal Document Templates have the following characteristics;
			<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Animal Documents contain a default Animal, a Tag and a set of representative events;
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						If a Tag is included as a child element of the Animal Element, the Tag/@idNumber is not considered significant and is ignored;
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Animal Documents are persisted in files with a *.animal extension;
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						All Animal Document Event Elements are significant and will be copied to the specified Animal or set Animals in the Premises Document;
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Date Time attributes of Animal Document Event Elements are considered significant and are copied to the Event Elements that are added to the specified Animal or set of Animal Elements in the Premises Document. The following are special exceptions;
						<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
							<listitem>
								<para>
									When a tags file name uses the format yyMMddHHmmss.tags. The Date Time attributes of all Event Elements copied to the Premises Document will assume the time stamp of of the date pattern
									<emphasis>yyMMddHHss</emphasis>
									. For example the tags file 060409131111.Tags will set the Date Time attribute of all Event Elements to 2006-04-09T13:11:11;
								</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									When the date of an event in an Animal Document Template is set to a year earlier than 1000 AD, then the date of the event copied to the Premises Document is set to the current time the Event.
								</para>
							</listitem>

						</orderedlist>
						<note>
							<para>
								Bulk loading of events is only applicable to the the Tracker Editor, when transaction Events and Animals are added to Premises Documents using the Tracker Transaction processing facility, the Event Element added to the Premises Document will always have the Date Time attributes set to the current time.

		<title>Tag IdNumber Files</title>
		<para>
			Commercial tag readers typically transmit animal id numbers to computers as
			<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
			encoded characters (For more information on ASCII, see the Wikipedia entry for
			<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">
				<citetitle>ASCII</citetitle>
			</ulink>
			). Tag Readers send this data to computers over serial communication ports or Bluetooth network connections. 
			<note>
				<para>
					In the Tracker Premises Model, the Tag id Numbers are represented as Tracker  
					<code>Tag/@idNumber</code> attributes.
				</para>
			</note>
			A convenient way to handle serial and/or Bluetooth tag id number transmissions is to setup the receiving computer's communication facility to capture this data as text files. 
			Capture files containing <acronym>ASCII</acronym> numbers that are saved with a *.tags extension are identified by Tracker as
			<emphasis>Tag IdNumber Files.</emphasis>
		</para>
		<para>
			To indicate to Tracker that the read time of the tags in a Tag IdNumber file is significant, the name of the tag file may be formated to reflect that time. To timestamp a Tag IdNumber file use the formating of
			<code>yyMMddHHmmss</code>
			, where
			<simplelist type='horiz' columns='1'>
				<member>yy is the last two digits of the year,</member>
				<member>MM is the month,</member>
				<member>dd is the day of the month,</member>
				<member>
					HH is the hour of the day in 24 hour clock,
				</member>
				<member>mm is the minute of the hour,</member>
				<member>ss is the second</member>
			</simplelist>
			<example>
				<title>A Time stamped Tag IdNumber File Name</title>
				<formalpara>
					<title>060409131111.tags</title>

						Specifies the date of all
						<code>Tag/@idNumber</code>
