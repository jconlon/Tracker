		<title>Modeling the Animal Premises</title>
		<para>
			Computers can be thought of as mechanisms or containers for
			modeling an aspect of the real world. The Tracker software
			application models the animals and events associated with or
		    contained within the premises of a farm or a livestock 
		    infrastructure provider. The Tracker application uses a 
		    document paradigm to model an animal premises.

		<para>
		     Whether it is word processing, 
		     spreadsheets, or presentation, today's computer 
		     users are most familiar with applications that utilize a 
		     document paradigm that create documents that represent (model)
		     information.
		</para>
		<para>
			The Tracker enables users to create, transform and edit 
			tracker model documents that represent (model) specific Animal Premises.
			Model documents are displayed and manipulated with the various Tracker 
			Editors, Wizards, and Importing and Exporting utilities. 
			The attributes of the premises, the animals in the premises and the events associated 
			with animals are specified within these model documents. 
			Model document files utilize a .tracker file extension to distinguish them
			from other file.
