		<para>
			The Tracker Model Editor is composed of several editor pages, Selection, Parent, List, Tree, Event History Table and Animals Table. Each page presents a different way of looking at the Elements in a Premises Document.
		</para>
		<para>The Outline View is synchronized with each page of the Tracker Model Editor and the Properties View. By selecting an element in the Outline View, that Element is also selected in all Tracker Model Editor pages and it's attributes are visualized in the Properties View.</para>
		<para>The Selection Page of the Tracker Model Editor is the main tree editor where all elements, their children, and attributes can be accessed.  In the Editor toolbar area the Tracker Model Editor provides additional functionality for collapsing and expanding the tree in the Selection Page; synchronizing the Selection Page from the Animals and Events Pages; and for focusing all pages on the Selection Page's selected elements.</para>
	
	     <note>
			<para>The Tracker Model Editor also supports an advanced element selection and query functionality, for details see
