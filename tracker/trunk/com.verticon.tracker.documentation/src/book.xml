			observed and remembered animal movements. Today with larger
			herds and more interaction between producers and

			into more information to manage.
		</para>
		<para>
			Computers, software applications and animal event sensors
			that sense, record and manage animal movements and histories
			can ease the information management burden and reduce the
			cost for farm animal producers and livestock infrastructure
			providers.
