		<para>
			The tracking and shepherding of animals are fundamental
			activities of all modern and prehistoric human
			civilizations. Either for hunting or husbandry human beings
			have always observed and remembered animal movements. Today
			with larger herds and more movements computer based tools to
			track animal movements can ease the burden and reduce the
			cost for farm animal producers and livestock infrastructure
			providers.
