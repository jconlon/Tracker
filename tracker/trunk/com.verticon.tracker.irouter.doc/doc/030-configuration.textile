h2. Configuration Administration Overview

iRouter problem solutions always begin by a rational examination of the problem, clarification of the use-case, and a theoretical design of a solution. The solution is then realized by adding the component instances representing the solution from a list of deployed component factories. Lastly the administrator configures the added instances and saves the configuration.

iRouter configurations conform to the OSGi *Metatype* document schema. One approach for editing configuration docuements is to use an external _XML_ (or text) editor to create the configuration and import it into the iRouter to activate it.  While that may work for the more technical administrator, a far easier approach is to use the Tracker iRouter _Configuration Editor_ for the editing process.

h2. Configuration Editor

!images/configuration.png!
__Example of the Configuration editor__

iRouter Configuration Editor is a full featured EMF(Eclipse Modeling Facility) editor with a special _Factories_ view that is optimized for dealing with iRouter Components _(components that have published _metatype_ resources)_.  The _Factories_ view will be described below.[6]

h3. Configuration editor Factories view tab

Clicking on the _Factories_ tab of the editor will bring up a master-detail page form. The master page will be a tree and the nodes of the tree will be all the iRouter _Component Factories_[7] that where deployed[8] to the iRouter.  Any service instances __(these are the entities that will do the real work)__ will be shown in the tree as children of the _Component Factory_ that created it. Clicking on a Factory parent or a Service instance child node in the master tree will show the details of the node in the details page[9]. 

h4. Creating a service instance

Select the desired _Component Factory_ in the master tree from which you would like to create a service instance.  The description of the _Component Factory_ will show in the _Factory Properties_ panel in the details page.  Select the green plus key to instruct the factory to create another service instance.

h4. Editing a service instance

To edit a service instance, select the service instance in the master tree and edit the _Service Configuration_ panel in the details page.

h4. Saving the configuration

To save the new or a changed configuration select _File_ and _Save_.

h4. Importing and exporting configurations

To export the active configuration, select the _Configuration_ menu and _Export iRouter Configuration_ and choose a directory and file name for the exported configuration file. 

Likewise to import a new configuration, select the _Configuration_ menu and _Import iRouter Configuration_ and choose a metatype file from the filesystem to import. 

h2. Notes

fn6. Future iRouter releases will include a more graphic editing facility.

fn7. A component factory is a __Factory for creating one or more service instances.__ 

fn8. All internal components and proxy components deployed to the iRouter are shown as component factories.  Like the Tracker Desktop, Tracker iRouter components are deployed and updated through the "Equinox P2":http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2 provisioning infrastructure.

fn9. The orientation of the master-details pages can be reset to above and below. To change orientation use the orientation tools in the upper right of the view.
