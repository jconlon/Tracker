h1. GPS Proxy Feature

The GPS(Global Positioning System) Proxy feature is an iRouter _Proxy Component Factory_ that creates user configurable services that interface with "GPS":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS devices. 


h2. Producer Scopes

GPS Proxy services are implemented as WireAdmin Producer services.[16] A GPS Proxy service connects to a GPS device[17] at a user configurable connection URI(Uniform Resource Identifier), parses and validates GPS Fix Data based on the "NMEA 0183":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183 "$GPGGA sentence":http://www.codepedia.com/1/The+GPGGA+Sentence and produces an "OSGi Position":http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/util/position/Position.html product containing Longitude, Latitude, and Altitude measurements. Position products are consumed by other iRouter _Business Logic Component_ instances.

h2. Notes

fn16. Scope names identify the information sent by a Producer service to a Consumer service. The iRouter determines connections based on scopes and wire group names.

fn17. The Tracker Device Simulator product has implemented a simulator of the GPS Proxy. The simulator can be used for testing and validating iRouter configurations utilizing GPS Service Instances.
