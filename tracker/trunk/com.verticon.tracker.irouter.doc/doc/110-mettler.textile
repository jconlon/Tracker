h2. Notes

fn11. Mettler Proxy services are implemented as WireAdmin Producer services.

fn12. The Tracker Device Simulator product has implemented a simulator of the Mettler balance. This simulator can be used for testing and validating iRouter configurations utilizing Mettler Service Instances. 

fn13. Scope names identify the information sent by a Producer service to a Consumer service. The iRouter determines connections based on scopes and wire group names.
