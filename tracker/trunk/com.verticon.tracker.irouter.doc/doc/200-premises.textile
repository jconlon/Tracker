h1. Premises Gateway Feature

The Premises Gateway feature is an iRouter feature that facilitates the bidirectional movement of information between _iRouter_ services and the _Tracker Premises Documents_.  

The Premises Gateway feature contains three iRouter Component Factories and an Gateway EventHandler.
* EID Reader Gateway Component Factory a factory for creating component gateways that transform EID(Electronic ID) numbers read from RFID(Radio Frequency ID) Tag Readers into iRouter _EID number_ products. 
* Measurement Event Gateway Component Factory a factory for creating component gateways that transform iRouter _Measurement_ and _Position_ products into EventAdmin Measurement and Position Events. 
* Gateway EventHandler a gateway service that transforms Measurement and Position events coming from the iRouter into Premises animal history events.
* Animal Life Data Gateway Component Factory for synchronizing animal life data to external devices.
