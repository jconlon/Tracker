h1=. BIRT Report Loader

com.verticon.birt.report.loader Version 0.1.0

{toc:style=disc|minLevel=2|maxLevel=3}


h2(. Introduction

When BIRT Designer is installed in Eclipse or an RCP, the ReportViewer runs as a Servlet. Reports can be run, from popup menus in the Navigator View or Web Browsers can launch reports by opening an URL with the proper parameters set to the ReportViewer Servlet.  When viewing reports with a Web Browser URL parameters are used to identify file system paths to report design documents and shared resource folders.  

If Reports and Resources are loaded to the ReportViewer Servlet Working Path folder (specified by the @birt.viewer.root.path@ system property), Reports can be called via a Browswer with URL parameters using relative non-system specific paths.


h2(. Requirements

Package BIRT Reports and Resources within plugins called Report Packs.

On startup:
 # find all Report Packs and load reports and resources into the default working directory of the ReportViewer servlet. 
 # set the User Preference for the Report Design Resource Folder to the value of the @birt.viewer.root.path@ property

h2(. Implementation
 
Create a plugin which on startup, finds all report pack bundles and loads all BIRT reports to ${birt.viewer.root.path}/report directory and BIRT Libraries and Styles to ${birt.viewer.root.path}/resource directory. 

This plugin will have to be assigned a start level of 3, so it will load prior to the `org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer`
