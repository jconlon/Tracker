h2. Introduction

Triggers are messages that interact with external programs or devices. Triggers can take the form of files or text sent to TCP ports.

h3. Trigger Files

Trigger files are files written to a directory that cause (or Trigger) a specification to occur.  External services can monitor a scan directory for these trigger files and triggers a specified action.  

h4. 

For example the printing of a label.  Trigger files can contain data that can be read by printing applications and placed within the fields of a label.   Trigger files can also contain commands that can specify certain functions, like use this label file or print from this printer.
	
h2. Label Printing Example

iRouter components can connect to scales and create Trigger files when a weight is placed on the scale.  The actual weight information is written inside of the Trigger file and interpreted by an external application to create weight fields with numbers. 

h2. User Interface

This component provides an Administration and an user interface for managing multiple trigger files. 

* Admin and user interfaces use a master table of triggers and form that shows the details of the selected trigger.
* Table columns can be sorted, moved and hidden and its rows can be filtered.
* Trigger entries are validated prior to save
* Direct generation of trigger files to support creating 'For retail Weighing' labels.
