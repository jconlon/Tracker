		<title>The Need for Animal Tracking</title>
		<para>
			Either for hunting or husbandry human beings have always
			observed and remembered animal movements. Today, with larger
			herds and more interaction between producers and
			infrastructure providers, more animal movements mean
		    more information for the producer or provider to manage.
		</para>
		<para>
			To ease the information management burden and reduce the
			cost for farm animal producers and livestock infrastructure
			providers, information technology solutions using
			computers, software applications and animal event sensors
			are required to record and manage animal movements and histories.
