h1=. iRouter Premises Common Producers

com.verticon.tracker.irouter.premises.common Version 0.2.0

{toc:style=disc|minLevel=2|maxLevel=3}


h2. Introduction

iRouter enables iRouter component based networks to produce and process measurement and position products that can be sent to Loggers and/or Premises Transaction Editors.

While the Tracker Desktop can be used by small to medium Livestock producers in an on-line production capacity, one or more desktop (or laptops) are not a good solution for larger enterprise operations. Why? 
* Large enterprises can not utilize the Tracker Transaction Editors as an online transaction processor, but instead require a hands off method for the automation of animal information acquisition. 
* iRouter logging components do not produce a full set of Animal event types, they only provide for measurements and positions to be sent to the logging adapters. 

Enterprise livestock operations need:
* high capacity, highly reliable, on-line transaction data acquisition
* components that can create a comprehensive set of animal event types 

This functionality can be provided by:

# A network of iRouter content event processors running in headless appliances connected to:
** network sensors
** network actuators
# The ability of network administrators to create 
## any of the modeled Tracker premises event types
## any new GenericEvent type
# The processing of sensor events 
# The interacting with network actuators 
# Data persistence to high capacity enterprise data stores.
# Off line analytical processing (OLAP) using
## Tracker Business Intelligence Toolkit featuring BIRT

h2. Functionality 

iRouter Premises Common Producers allow iRouter networks to utilize the full set of Tracker Premises events by adding the following components:
# A component that consumes Animal EIDs, Triggering states, and raw Measurements and Position products and produces products identified with an animal EID
# A component that will:
** associate an external premises document containing an Animal with an event history
** consume Animal EID products as forwarding triggers
** produce Envelopes identified with the EID and containing the Animal as a value

h2. com.verticon.tracker.irouter.premises.event

Implements an *iRouter* Composite *Consumer-Producer* that consumes unidentified Measurement, Position, and animal EID envelopes and produces Measurement and Position envelopes ''identified'' with an EID.

h3. Consumer

Consumes the following Product Envelopes

# Long from EID producers
# Position from GPS producers
# GenericEvent from proxies
# WeighIn from proxies
# State as forwarding triggers

h3. Producer

Produces Envelopes that are identified with an Animal EID and containing one of the following Values:
# Position
# Measurement with Envelope scope WeighIn 
# Measurement with Envelope scope associated with the OCD name of an GenericEvent

h2. com.verticon.tracker.irouter.premises.animal

Implements an *iRouter* Composite *Consumer-Producer* that consumes an EID triggering event and produces one or more Premises events that are copied from a referenced animal template document.

h3. Consumer

Consumes the following Product Envelopes
# Long from EID producers that act as a trigger for production 
# State as forwarding triggers

h3. Producer

Produces Animal Envelopes that are identified with an Animal EID and contain an Animal with tag and events that are time-stamped at production

h2. iRouter Support

iRouter sensor and actuator networks can now use MongoDB for real time transaction recording of any Tracker Premises events.  

The following is a system configuration where the iRouter Premises Common Producers are producing products that are archived to an enterprise data store.

h2. iRouter Example

Goal: Demonstrate an iRouter component configuration that highlights the functionality of the Tracker Mongo Store
# Components used
## TruTest Proxy 
*** This will serve at the top of the event production chain to produce events associated with a TruTest scale head indicator
**** The scale will produce events as the weights of the animals are changed, these weight measurements will be sent in the _raw.animal.weight_ scope
**** When an animal EID is detected on the scale head that eid will be produced in the _animal.eid_ scope
**** When the operator presses the Enter Button that event will be produced in the _transaction.state_ scope  
## Premises Event Producer
*** This component will consume all products sent by the TruTest Proxy and on the detection of a _transaction.state_ indicating that the operator pressed the Enter Button, this component will produce the last measurement received and identify it with the animal eid.
## Premises Animal Producer
*** This component also sits towards the top of the event production chain, but consumes Animal EIDs on the _animal.eid_ scope and Enter Button presses on the _transaction.state_ scope that have originated on the TruTest Proxy.  Associated with this component is a _URI_ referencing an Tracker Premises Animal template in an external document. Production cycle of this component starts when a Enter Button press is detected. Then the Animal Template is copied, given the EID from the TruTest, and sent to consumers.
## Tracker Mongo Store consumes products from the Premises Event Producer and the Premises Animal Producer and creates these on the MongoDB. 
# Startup and Configuration
## MongoDB must be installed and running on the local host
## Startup Tracker
## From the _Configuration_ menu, invoke _Import iRouter Configuration_
## Import that configuration _autotype.metatype_ document in this project
# TruTest simulator
## Download and install the Tracker simulator product 
## In the installation directory run the simulator executable
## In a web browser go to "Simulated Devices":http://localhost:8081/client/devices and start the TruTest simulator
## Select a TruTest simulator 
## When the TruTest simulator comes up the _Connection_ should be Y
## Change the EID, the weight and press the record button to simulate a transaction
