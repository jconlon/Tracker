h1. Overview

h2. What is the Tracker iRouter?

The Tracker iRouter is a user configurable _Information Router_. iRouter runs a configurable suite of acquisition, integration, and information transformation services.  End users orchestrate these services as producer-consumer integration solutions for retrieving data from third party network and subnetwork attached data acquisition devices and sensors.

h2. How does it work?

Services are component __(aka - plugin)__ based and can be easily created and deployed to the iRouter via internetwork software repositories.  iRouter components conform to the most widely recognized industry standard for services based components - "OSGi":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi_Specification_Implementations.  

Each iRouter component conforms to the following OSGi services:

* Wire Administration Service
* Configuration Administration Service 
* Metatype Service

Any OSGi component offering the above standard services can be deployed to the iRouter and offer new functionality. 

h3. iRouter is highly configurable

Besides standards the iRouter is all about presenting the user with a context for administering the components running in the iRouter.

Users can :
* create and configure the iRouter to access network accessible data sources, sensors,  data acquisition devices, 
* create and configure components to perform specific functional tasks related to information acquisition and transformation, 
* create and configure __wired__ service groups to provide higher level functionality,
* start or stop services.
